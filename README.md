This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates the use of golden tests with BDD (behavior-driven development) in a Flutter project. Golden tests are a way to test the visual appearance of widgets by comparing their output to a "golden" image. This allows developers to catch regressions in the visual design of their application, and ensure that changes to the codebase do not unintentionally alter the appearance of the app.

BDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between developers, QA, and stakeholders to define and implement the behavior of an application. By using BDD, developers can create a shared understanding of the requirements for the application, and ensure that the code they write meets those requirements.

The sample application in this repository includes a set of golden tests that cover several scenarios, including testing the visual appearance of a login screen and a home screen. The tests use the "flutter_test" package, package to run the tests and compare the output to the golden images.

To run the tests, you can use the command "flutter test" in the root of the project.

I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for learning about golden tests and BDD in a Flutter project. Happy coding!
